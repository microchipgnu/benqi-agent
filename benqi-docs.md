BENQI is a suite of leading DeFi protocols built on . In a short period of time, BENQI has become the #1 application on Avalanche (by TVL) thanks to BENQI's core products, each with deep liquidity and extensive integrations across the DeFi landscape.

**BENQI's 4 core products include:**

1. **:** For staking AVAX in exchange for sAVAX, deployable throughout DeFi while still earning staking rewards.

2. **:** For lending borrowing, and earning interest on digital assets within both core and isolated markets.

3. **:** For fast and easy deployment of Avalanche validators, catering to institutions, developers, and Web3 users.

4. For receiving AVAX delegations and rewards, if you run an AVAX validator by voting with

BENQI tokenizes staked AVAX through liquid staking and issues **sAVAX**, a liquid staking token that is widely integrated throughout the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem.

Users can stake directly from the Avalanche C-Chain, eliminating the need to bridge assets to the P-Chain. Additionally, users can hold, swap, or collateralize their sAVAX to earn additional yield while maintaining liquidity.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/\#benqi-markets)    BENQI Markets

Users can lend, borrow, and earn interest with their digital assets.

**Depositors** providing liquidity to the protocol earn yield, while **borrowers** can access funds through over-collateralized loans. All positions can be easily monitored through our newly designed user interface.

There are two primary markets:

- **Core Markets:** BENQI's primary lending and borrowing pools designed for highly liquid assets such as AVAX and USDC.

- **Avalanche Ecosystem Markets:**: Designed to support a broader range of assets, including long-tail crypto assets and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). These markets feature specialized risk management to ensure that volatility or liquidity issues in one market don’t impact the others, providing more flexibility for DeFi users.


### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/\#ignite)    Ignite

It can be technologically challenging to launch an Avalanche validator, and require significant upfront capital.

Ignite is BENQI’s solution that makes it **fast and easy to launch and run Avalanche validators and Subnets** with minimal little-to-no upfront capital and no technical complexities.

Ignite offers two key options, allowing users to choose the one that best suits their needs:

- **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)**: Run a validator with no upfront AVAX by paying a weekly fee. Ideal for short-term use cases like MEV Solvers.

- **Stake**: Stake QI and cover hosting fees to run automated validators and earn QI rewards without the need to manage any technical details.


### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/\#node-voting)    Node Voting

BENQI's liquid staking pool allocates AVAX to validators on the Avalanche network, using a 35/65 delegation split as follows:

- **BENQI Miles Pool (35%)**: Delegated based on community-driven votes, where BENQI Miles holders select specific validators through Node Voting.

- Open Pool (65%): Randomly allocated to all validators who meet the minimum criteria.


Therefore, Node Voting applies only to the BENQI Miles Pool.

It's the governance feature whereby holders of BENQI Miles tokens can support specific validators on the Avalanche network. By voting with their BENQI Miles, users can influence how AVAX from BENQI’s Liquid Staking Pool is delegated to validators.

Related to this are BENQI Miles, which have two options for accrual:

1. **Flex Option:** What exists today. Miles accrue gradually over time as users stake their QI, with full benefits accumulating after a specified period.

2. **Lock Option:** A planned feature that has not yet been implemented. Miles accrue instantly upon staking, but users face a delayed exit period when they choose to unstake.


## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/\#risks)    Risks

While BENQI is designed to minimize risks, no blockchain protocol is entirely risk-free. **Smart Contract risks** and **Liquidation risks** are potential considerations when interacting with the protocol. BENQI mitigates these risks by undergoing rigorous audits and maintaining a public, open-source codebase for transparency and security.

We covered these in further detail in the [Risks & Audits](https://docs.benqi.fi/resources/risks) section.

[BENQI Miles.](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqinomics/benqinomics)BENQI Liquid Staking is the leading liquid staking protocol built on Avalanche, surpassing $250M in Total Value Locked (TVL) by solving a critical issue: **illiquidity**.

Avalanche, as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, enables users to earn rewards by staking AVAX tokens to secure the network. However, staking on the Avalanche Platform Chain (P-Chain) locks AVAX tokens, making them inaccessible and illiquid.

**By issuing sAVAX, BENQI unlocks liquidity for staked AVAX, allowing users to engage in DeFi activities while earning passive staking rewards.**

BENQI also provides staking infrastructure solutions that make it easy for anyone to start running their own validators. We cover this in the [Ignite](https://docs.benqi.fi/ignite/overview) section.

Users can stake AVAX for sAVAX and then deploy it for yield

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-liquid-staking/overview\#what-is-benqi-liquid-staking)    **What is BENQI Liquid Staking?**

BENQI's liquid staking infrastructure tokenizing staked AVAX and allows users to freely use it within DeFi applications such as AMMs, lending & borrowing protocols, yield aggregators, etc. For example, one could stake their AVAX, receive sAVAX, and lend that out via BENQI Markets for yield.

Furthermore, rather than bridge funds from the C-Chain to the P-Chain (where staking occurs), BENQI BENQI allows users to stake AVAX directly on the C-Chain and then securely and automatically bridges assets over using MPC encryption.

Key benefits of staking AVAX via BENQI include:

- **DeFi Integrations**: sAVAX is integrated into various DeFi protocols, meaning users can earn both staking rewards and DeFi yields simultaneously. For instance, sAVAX could be lent through BENQI or a separate lending protocol for additional yield, supplied to any liquidity pool containing sAVAX (e.g. sAVAX/AVAX), and much more.

- **Cross-Chain Staking**: As Avalanche staking on occurs on the Avalanche P-Chain, users must normally bridge tokens from the C-Chain to the P-Chain. BENQI simplifies the staking process by allowing users to stake AVAX directly on the C-Chain, using secure MPC encryption to bridge assets to the P-Chain automatically. Without this integration, users would have to bridge their AVAX manually.

- **No Lock-Up Periods & Zero Fees**: Enjoy the flexibility to unstake your AVAX anytime without long-term commitments. There are also no fees for staking, depositing, or withdrawing your AVAX.


## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-liquid-staking/overview\#what-is-savax)    What is sAVAX?

**sAVAX** is the token users receive when staking their AVAX on BENQI Liquid Staking. It represents their staked position and accrues interest from Avalanche staking rewards.

Users can exchange sAVAX for AVAX + staking rewards via the Unstake tab in the BLS app. The price of sAVAX increases over time based on the amount of staked AVAX in the pool and accrued rewards.

sAVAX Price = `total AVAX staked / total sAVAX minted * AVAX price`

For example, if there are 10,000 AVAX staked and 9,000 sAVAX minted, with the current AVAX price at $100, the sAVAX price would be approximately $111.11.

A few other pieces of information worth noting:

- **Transferability**: Unlike directly running or delegating AVAX to a node, sAVAX is transferable and can be used across DeFi applications like AMMs, lending platforms, and derivatives.

- **Unstaking**: AVAX can be unstaked anytime with a 15-day unlock period, during which sAVAX continues to accrue rewards. Rewards stop accruing only during the final 2-day redemption period after the unstake request is processed. For immediate liquidity, secondary markets offer instant swaps between sAVAX and AVAX based on the market rate.

- **Rewards Accrual**: sAVAX automatically accrues rewards based on the staking rate. For example, a 7.2% APR in staking rewards means your sAVAX will be worth 7.2% more in AVAX after one year.

- **Protocol Revenue**: While no fees are charged, the protocol earns 10% of the rewards generated by validators, including a portion of the delegator fees.


Last updated 5 months ago**Avalanche Ecosystem Markets** on BENQI provide a lending and borrowing environment separate from the Core Markets, specifically designed to support more exotic or volatile assets within the Avalanche ecosystem. By isolating these markets, BENQI allows users to engage with a wider variety of assets while maintaining risk management and protecting the core protocol from potential liquidity risks.

Each isolated market operates independently, ensuring that risks from one market, such as volatility or liquidity issues, do not affect others or destabilize the Core Markets.

![](https://docs.benqi.fi/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2452785816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MViz_ikDZy4OemUj_VI%252Fuploads%252FrnhA4yY6qHrZWslgAsUT%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dcac6de9a-3832-4b12-9369-dc4757d78ade&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=e77799b&sv=2)

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/avalanche-ecosystem-markets\#key-features)    Key Features

- **Supporting Long-Tail and Exotic Assets:** Certain assets may not necessarily meet the liquidity or risk standards of BENQI's Core Markets. Avalanche Ecosystem Markets allow developers to introduce new markets as they please.

- **Collateralization and Interest Rate Models:** Just like in Core Markets, configurations for isolated markets are proposed and managed by Chaos Labs. This includes strict rules regarding collateralization ratios and interest rates, tailored for each individual asset to ensure optimal risk management.

- **USDC Loans Only:** Users can supply assets as collateral in an isolated market but may only borrow USDC. This prevents potential market manipulation or liquidity crunches that could hard ecosystem liquidity.

- **Multi-Asset Repayments:** Loans can be repaid with multiple ERC20 tokens, provided they have sufficient liquidity. This ensures users have greater flexibility when managing their loans.


As with the Core Markets, the configurations are proposed by Chaos Labs (the team behind BENQI).

We recently introduced our RWA Platform, where each lending pool is structured as an Avalanche Ecosystem Pool. This platform expands BENQI's lending capabilities by integrating real-world assets into the Avalanche ecosystem. For more information visit [RWA PLATFORM](https://docs.benqi.fi/rwa-platform/governance)

Last updated 5 months agoCore Markets on BENQI represent the primary lending and borrowing pools for **widely used, highly liquid assets** such as AVAX, QI, USDC, DAI, WBTC, and more.

Users can deposit assets into Core Markets to earn interest, which is determined algorithmically based on the supply and demand of each asset. These deposits also serve as collateral, allowing users to borrow other assets within the platform. Borrowing limits are determined by the collateralization ratio of the deposited assets, ensuring that all loans are backed by sufficient collateral to maintain market stability.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/core-markets\#key-features)    Key Features

- **Collateral Flexibility:** Users can supply assets to the Core Markets as collateral and borrow a variety of tokens, including stablecoins and more volatile assets.

- **Market Stability:** Core Markets are designed with broad liquidity and lower risk, ensuring stability for assets that are widely traded and used across the Avalanche ecosystem.

- **Borrow Any Asset:** In Core Markets, users can borrow any available asset using their deposits as collateral, providing flexibility across the platform. In contrast, Avalanche Ecosystem Markets only allow borrowing stablecoins like USDC.


Example: Lending AVAX [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/core-markets#example-lending-avax)

Suppose you hold AVAX and believe its value will increase over time, but you need liquidity for a new investment.

Instead of selling your AVAX, you can deposit it into BENQI's Core Markets, earning interest. You could then use it as collateral to borrow USDC against your AVAX. This allows you to retain your AVAX exposure while accessing liquidity for other opportunities, without needing to sell your original asset.

However, as mentioned, one should be mindful of liquidation risk. If AVAX’s value suddenly drops, your collateral ratio may decrease, putting your loan at risk of liquidation unless you repay part of the loan or add more collateral to maintain a healthy position.

We cover liquidations in-depth here: [Protocol Parameters](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/protocol-parameters)

Users should always be cautious about the health of their loans. For example, if they lend out an asset like AVAX and borrow against it, a sudden drop in AVAX’s value could lower their collateral ratio, putting them at risk of liquidation. To avoid this, users may need to repay part of the loan or add more collateral to maintain a healthy loan position.

We cover this in greater depth in [Health & Liquidations](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/health-and-liquidations)

Core Markets contain highly liquid assets such as AVAX, BTC, QI, BUSD, USDC, USDT, and more.

Last updated 5 months agoIn this section, we will provide a walkthrough on how to get started with:

- **Depositing:** Supplying assets into either **Core Markets** or **Avalanche Ecosystem Markets.**

- **Borrowing:** Accessing liquidity by using deposited assets as loan collateral.


To borrow, one must first deposit assets.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/getting-started\#dashboard-and-first-steps)    Dashboard & First Steps

To get started, visit [BENQI Markets.](https://app.benqi.fi/)

We have created a dashboard that provides an overview of all your positions. Upon connecting your wallet, you will be able to see:

- Your total **net worth**

- **Net APY** (Annual Percentage Yield)

- **Health Factor**, which reflects the safety of your collateralized positions

- **Available rewards** to claim

- **Supplied and borrowed assets** for real-time monitoring

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/getting-started\#depositing)    Depositing

To borrow, users must first deposit assets, which will act as collateral. Depositing assets in the **Core Markets** is required before borrowing or engaging in other market activities.

We provide a graphic below showing the interface. Based on this graphic, we will show how to get started in supplying your assets.

![](https://docs.benqi.fi/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2452785816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MViz_ikDZy4OemUj_VI%252Fuploads%252F6rgs7QXcnm9hiYIQ6m9Z%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D17c60e6a-8f7f-4353-88cd-c5a729ac050b&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=deba441f&sv=2)

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/getting-started\#steps-to-deposit)    Steps to Deposit

1. **Select the Asset**: We'll use the graphic as an example. In this scenario, the user has selected **AVAX** from the drop-down list of available assets.

2. **Input the Amount**: Enter the amount of AVAX you wish to supply in the input field. You can also click the **Max** button to supply your entire AVAX balance.

3. **Enable Collateral (Optional)**: Toggle the " **Use as Collateral"** button if you'd like your deposited AVAX to be used as collateral for borrowing other assets. If you turn this on, your AVAX will be locked as collateral, affecting your **Health Factor** and borrowing power.

4. **Review the Details**: Check the values for **"Health After Supplying"** and **"Supply Balance,"** both located on the right side of the screen, to understand how your deposit will affect your overall position. Ensure that the **Collateral Factor** and any borrowing limits meet your needs.

5. **Confirm and Deposit**: After inputting the desired amount of AVAX, click the **Supply** button to confirm the transaction. This will initiate the deposit, and AVAX will be supplied to the protocol. You will start earning interest (displayed as **"Supply APY"**) based on deposited assets.


## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/getting-started\#borrowing)    Borrowing

Users may borrow funds once they have deposited assets. The reason for this is that the deposited assets act as collateral, ensuring that the loan is backed by sufficient value to mitigate the risk for both the borrower and the protocol.

![](https://docs.benqi.fi/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2452785816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MViz_ikDZy4OemUj_VI%252Fuploads%252FaQLVoCpcV3a9qsQfej6h%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5e18199a-730b-48ce-9ecf-a7daa81ca329&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=264f1d67&sv=2)

The Borrow tab is where you can borrow assets, using previously deposited assets as collateral.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/getting-started\#steps-to-borrow)    Steps to Borrow

Once users have deposited assets, they can take out a loan with their supplied assets as collateral.

1. **Navigate to the Borrow Section**: In the BENQI Markets dashboard, switch from the "Supply" tab to the **"Borrow"** tab. Here, you’ll see the assets available for borrowing along with their corresponding borrow APY.

2. **Select the Asset to Borrow**: Choose the asset you’d like to borrow from the available list (e.g., QI or USDC). You’ll also see the **APY** for borrowing that asset, helping you understand the cost of your loan.

3. **Enter the Amount**: Input the amount of the asset you'd like to borrow, ensuring that the amount is within your borrowing limit based on the collateral you’ve supplied. Your **borrowing limit** will be displayed based on the collateralization ratio of your deposited assets.

4. **Confirm the Transaction**: After verifying the amount, click the **Borrow** button to initiate the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, the borrowed amount will be transferred to your wallet, and you will begin accruing interest on the borrowed funds.


Last updated 5 months agoHealth is a numeric indicator of the safety of a user’s collateralized position and represents the ratio between total deposited collateral and the total loan value.

**When Health falls below 1, a liquidation is triggered**.

This means that a portion of the user’s collateral is automatically sold to repay their loan and cover any associated fees. For example, in BENQI's Core Markets, if the collateralization ratio for AVAX is 50%, this means you can borrow up to 50% of the value of your AVAX deposit. If AVAX falls significantly in price, a liqudation may be triggered.

A higher Health value means the collateral is safer from liquidation. Health decreases when collateral loses value or when the borrowed debt increases.

To improve Health, users can repay part or all of the borrowed amount or add more collateral. The protocol also displays Health status using color-coded indicators:

- **Health > 2 (** **Green** **):** Collateral is safe from liquidation.

- **Health < 1.99 (** **Orange** **):** Caution, collateral may be at risk.

- **Health < 1.1 (** **Red** **):** High risk of liquidation.

- **Health < 1:** Liquidation will occur.


For example, a user may have lent out AVAX to borrow $100 of another asset. If the AVAX is now worth $108, their ratio would be 1.08, and in the Red zone approaching liquidation.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/health-and-liquidations\#liquidations-in-action)    Liquidations In Action

When a position's Health falls below 1, a portion of the collateral will be liquidated to restore the loan to a safer position.

BENQI uses a **Close Factor**, which limits the portion of the debt that can be repaid in a single liquidation transaction. For example, if the close factor is set to 50%, only up to 50% of the user’s debt can be liquidated at once. This prevents the total debt from being repaid in a single liquidation, allowing the user to retain some collateral and avoid complete liquidation of their assets.

Upon liquidation, liquidators repay a portion of the debt, and BENQI sells the corresponding amount of collateral. This includes a **Liquidation Incentive** (usually 10%) to reward liquidators, added to the amount of collateral taken. For example, if $50 of debt is liquidated with a 10% incentive, $45.5 worth of collateral would be paid to the liquidated party, and $4.5 would be given as a reward to liquidators.

Both the Close Factor and Liquidation Incentive are covered in greater detail in [Protocol Parameters](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/protocol-parameters)

🏛️BENQI Markets enable users to earn interest on their deposits and borrow against their holdings. This means they can maintain their exposure to potential asset appreciation while accessing additional capital to enter new positions.

For example, a user may wish to enter a new position but lacks available funds and does not wish to sell their existing $QI tokens.

They could:

1. Deposit $QI into the BENQI protocol as collateral

2. Borrow $USDC or another asset against their lent $QI

3. Use the borrowed asset to enter positions


Imagine they used borrowed funds to purchase $BTC.

If both $BTC and the collateralized $QI appreciate in price, they could repay their $BTC loan and still maintain ownership of their $QI holdings. This approach allows the user to profit from the appreciation of both assets while maximizing capital efficiency. Once the loan is repaid, they can reclaim their $QI collateral and retain any additional gains from the $BTC investment.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-markets/overview\#core-markets-and-avalanche-ecosystem-markets)    Core Markets & Avalanche Ecosystem Markets

There are two core types of lending markets:

1. **Core Markets:** BENQI's primary lending and borrowing pools are designed for highly liquid assets such as AVAX and USDC, offering lower risk and stable returns.

2. **Avalanche Ecosystem Markets:** Focused on long-tail crypto assets and RWAs, with carefully crafted risk parameters to ensure that volatility or liquidity issues in one market do not affect the others. Users may only borrow $USDC against these positions.


Last updated 5 months ago**The BENQI Core Team adjusts five key parameters** to ensure stability and maintain liquidity across the platform. Over time, this will be increasingly decentralized.

The five parameters include:

1. **Collateral Factor:** How much a user can borrow against a specific asset. A higher collateral factor allows users to borrow more, but also increases liquidation risk.


For example, if AVAX has a collateral factor of 40%, and AVAX is priced at $100, the maximum amount that can be borrowed is $40 in other assets. A higher collateral factor means more can be borrowed but increases the liquidation risk.

1. **Reserve Factor:** The percentage of interest paid by borrowers that's kept by BENQI and allocated to the protocol's reserves for financial sustainability purposes. This reserve ensures that the protocol can remain stable and resilient in varying market conditions.


For example, with a reserve factor of 20%, 20% of the interest paid by borrowers is collected by the protocol, helping to maintain liquidity buffers and safeguard against potential liquidity shortages or market volatility.

1. **Close Factor:** The maximum amount to be liquidated in a single transaction.


For example, with a 50% Close Factor, up to 50% of a liquidatable account's debt can be liquidated in one transaction. If an account had $1,000 in debt that became eligible for liquidation, a liquidator could liquidate up to $500 in one go.

1. **Liquidation Incentive:** The reward provided to liquidators for closing under-collateralized positions and ensuring the protocol's sustainability.


For instance, a 10% liquidation incentive means liquidators receive an additional 10% of the borrower's collateral as compensation for executing the liquidation. If a borrower is liquidated with $100 worth of collateral and the liquidation incentive is 10%, the liquidator would receive $110 in return for liquidating the position.

1. **Interest Rate Models:** BENQI’s interest rates are based on the utilization rate of each asset market, which refers to the ratio of total assets borrowed to total assets supplied. As utilization rates increase (i.e., more assets are borrowed), interest rates rise, incentivizing others to supply the asset while discouraging further borrowing to maintain liquidity. Conversely, when utilization is low, interest rates decrease to encourage borrowing.


BENQI currently uses the **Jump Rate Model**, which is more efficient at incentivizing liquidity at higher utilization rate, as illustrated in the following chart:

![](https://docs.benqi.fi/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2452785816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MViz_ikDZy4OemUj_VI%252Fuploads%252FNyhiXFXf89ihVq9So83C%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd66e5a1e-b37f-4b00-9f12-050a5a1075c2&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=22b1f66b&sv=2)
